### 摘要: PMI-ACP

## <font color=#0000FF>Schedule buffer types</font>
1.	Feature buffer
2.	Project buffer
3.	Feeding buffer(hand over)
4.	Resources buffer

### 3 famous theory: 
	Parkinson’s law(too sufficient work cause unnecessary more work ); 
	Murphy’s law(whatever can happen, then it will happen); 
	Peter’s law(someone could reach the position until he can’t go on higher)

### Two guideline to buffer estimation
1.	Plan project buffer more than 10 user stories
2.	Ensure the project buffer at least represent 20% of total project duration 

## <font color=#0000FF>Monitor agile project</font>
2 ways: 
1.	Daily standup
a)	What you have done since last standup
b)	What will you do in the coming day
c)	Any risk
2.	Backlog grooming
a)	Prior to development
b)	10% effort during sprint.
c)	Keep simple as much possible

## <font color=#0000FF>Tracking process</font>
Tools for release tracking:
1.	Release for burn down/up chart
2.	Parking lot chart(name of theme, number of user stories, total story points, percent done)
3.	Defect report

### Agile EVM
1.	Project cost
2.	Items in backlog
3.	Release Plan
4.	Velocity of team

### Leading KPI
1.	Product owner’s time
2.	Depth of ready for Dev in the backlog item

### Lagging KPI
1.	Estimated effort/Actual effort
2.	Number of defects/iteration
3.	Actual velocity


## <font color=#0000FF>Risk management</font>
### Risk Types
1.	Productivity variation
2.	Scope creep
3.	Specification breakdown
4.	Personal loss
5.	Poor estimation

### Risk Categories
1.	Business 
2.	Technical
3.	Logistics
4.	Political

### Mitigate risk
1.	Pre-Mortem activities
2.	Variance(actual VS expect variance)
3.	Introspective
4.	Value stream mapping(Lean process)
