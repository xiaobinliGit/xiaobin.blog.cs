### 摘要: Plan practice for agile project
<!--more-->

## <font color=#0000FF>Initializing a agile project</font>
### Business case: 
1.	opptunity(ability to meet business object), 
2.	goals(why, detailed mearsurable kpi), 
3.	strategy(plan to achieve goals), 
4.	project vision(Purpose), 
5.	milestone(track), 
6.	investment(customer investment based on milestone), 
7.	expected payback(output to customer).

### Project Vision
1.	Why you build the project
2.	Benifit about project may have
3.	Who you build for
4.	All stakeholders
5.	Review to establish max or min requirements
6.	Investigate the potential relationship between risk and benifit about the project
7.	Focus on how the project add value over detail features


### Project Chart
1.	A vision statement
2.	Objectives or the missions about the project
3.	Customer
4.	Problem
5.	Success condition
6.	Priorities and compromises
7.	Risk and mitigation
8.	Team roles
9.	JUST ONE PAGE under agile


## <font color=#0000FF>Project Contract</font>
1. One possible solution for traiditional fix-price contract is that a contract is to specify the overall business goal that the project team must enable a customer to meet . But this is not possible in practice
2. In agile project, one solution is to define different contract during different agile project DEV phase.

### Content
1.	Release Planning(High requirement)
	a)	Project Goal
	b)	Define US
	c)	Priority of US
	d)	Estimate US
	e)	Grouping US
	f)	Setting a release date
2.	Iteration Planning(sprint)
	a)	Confirming US PR by sprint
	b)	Decouple US
	c)	Refining estimation
	d)	Update requirement if need 
3.	Progress elaboration
	a)	Change in scope
	b)	Requirements
	c)	Priorities
4.	To get rid of scope creep, drop low priority content is the first choice

### Persona
1.	Based on reality
2.	Being specific
3.	Defining persona goal
4.	Identify and include negative person
5.	Create primary persona and secondary persona


### Agile estimate technologies
1.	Story points
	a)	Level of complexity
	b)	Level of unknowns
	c)	Effort requirements
2.	Ideal day
3.	Relative sizing(no exact estimation, just by experts or key stakeholders)
4.	Wideband Delphi
5.	Poke
6.	Affinity Estimation

### Value-base priorities: ROI,NPV,IRR,MVP
### Customer-base priorities: Kano(costomer satisfication degree VS implementation degree)

### MoSCoW Model
1.	Must have
2.	Should have 
3.	Could have
4.	Won’t have(Exclude the US map)

### Guideline for changing release plan into iteration plan(INVEST)
1.	Independent
2.	Negotiable
3.	Valuable
4.	Estimable
5.	Small
6.	Testable
