### 摘要: Agile Way for software development
<!--more-->
近期被组织提选为敏捷教练，之后会以agile为基础，大规模部署SAFe(Scailed Agile Framework),但我先从基础记录做起。下面是一些PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner认证学习过程中的一些笔记。

## Agile principle
1. Incremental and iterative 
2. Focus the highest value requirements
3. Issues get identified earlier
4. Feedback is received earlier
5. Changes are easier to implement

## Agile value
1. We value individuls and interactions over process and tools
2. We value working software over comprehensive documentation
3. We value customer collaboration over contract negotiation(change is constant)
4. We value responding the change over following the plan

## Agile Manifesto(from: http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customerthrough early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
